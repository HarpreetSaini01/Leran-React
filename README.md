It's never too late to restart our careers. I was having almost 5 years of gap when i started seraching jon in IT. It was very difficult phase as no one was ready to take me because of my Gap but I never lose hope and one fine day i was selected as fresher. I am revising all the front-end core skills like javascript, CSS, HTML, and other libraries as I started my career in Testing but now from almost 1.5 year I am in development. Learning and implemneting react is now on top of my list.
